<b>About me</b>
<br>
I'm a full-time Aprentice IT Specialist in Systemintegrations from Germany, currently focused on little Python Projects. I began experimenting
with code at the age of 15 and have been on and off about it ever since.

<b>What else?</b>
<br>
My main interests lie in keeping track of vulnerabilities, where I can apply my skills and passions to create efficient and
scalable solutions. Besides coding, I also spend a lot of my free time either at work/school also into gaming adventures.
